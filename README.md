 # Summary
 
 This game was tons of fun to work on. This is the second game I've made, my first being a Rock Paper Scissors game which you can also check out [here](https://cesarpreza.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/). The main takeaway I took from making this Snake Game was working with the canvas element. Working on this alone shows how versatile the canvas is. Also having to think about how the Snake and Apple in the game work together and having their locations be mapped on the canvas was a tough but fun puzzle to solve. Overall this was a fun project and a great stepping stone for game creation.
